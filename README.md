## Project Abstract

Real-time object detection on edge devices is constrained by high computational load, power consumption, and latency when using CPU-based inference pipelines. These systems process full image frames continuously, leading to inefficient use of resources.

This project introduces an **event-driven hardware accelerator for real-time object detection**, where computation is triggered only by relevant events. By eliminating frame-based redundancy and exploiting massive hardware parallelism, the proposed architecture achieves **significantly lower latency and power consumption** compared to CPU implementations. The modular and scalable design enables efficient deployment on FPGA and future ASIC platforms for real-time edge intelligence.

##  Contributions

* **Event-Driven Accelerator Architecture**
    Designed a novel event-driven hardware accelerator for real-time object detection, where computation is triggered only by meaningful events instead of continuous frame-based processing. This architecture significantly reduces redundant operations, lowers latency, and improves energy efficiency compared to traditional CPU-based inference.

* **Event Queue and Scheduling Mechanism (`event_queue.v`)**
    Introduced an event queue module to buffer, prioritize, and manage incoming events efficiently. This module enables asynchronous event handling, supports bursty event traffic, and ensures smooth scheduling without stalling downstream processing elements.

* **Dynamic Event Routing Network (`event_router.v`)**

### Event-Driven Architecture Overview

Building upon conventional CNN accelerator designs, our architecture introduces a **fully event-driven processing paradigm with sparse connectivity**, enabling computation to occur **only when meaningful events are detected**. This fundamentally departs from frame-based execution and significantly reduces redundant computation, memory access, and power consumption.

As illustrated in Fig. X, the core of the system is organized as a **4×2 event-driven cluster array**, which can be scaled up or down depending on performance and resource requirements. For FPGA validation, the design is configured with a reduced cluster size to accommodate logic and memory constraints, while preserving architectural scalability for future ASIC implementations.

---

### Event Encoding and Sparse Data Preparation

The **event encoder group** is responsible for converting incoming sensor or image data into sparse event streams. Instead of processing full frames, only regions exhibiting significant changes generate events. These events are compactly represented and stored in event buffers, minimizing SRAM utilization.

Sparse activations and weights are handled natively by the architecture, ensuring that both memory access and computation scale with the number of active events rather than input size.

---

### Event-Driven Cluster Array

At the heart of the accelerator lies the **Event PE Cluster**, consisting of a **3×3 array of event-aware Processing Elements (PEs)**. Each PE remains idle until it receives a valid event, at which point computation is triggered. This sparse activation model drastically reduces idle switching activity and improves energy efficiency.

---

### Event Global Load Balancer (Event GLB)

The **Event GLB Cluster** functions as the distributed on-chip memory system. It includes:
- Dedicated SRAM banks for storing sparse input activations and events  
- Separate SRAM banks for partial sums (psums) generated during event-triggered computation  

This separation allows concurrent access patterns and reduces contention during high event density.

---

### Event Routing Network

The **Event Router Cluster** manages internal data movement within the cluster array. It consists of:
- Event routers for distributing event packets  
- Weight routers optimized for sparse weight access  
- Psum routers that forward results only when valid computations occur  

Compared to traditional always-on routing logic, the routers are **simplified and event-triggered**, activating only when data movement is required. This design choice enhances routing efficiency while reducing unnecessary switching activity.

---

### Layer-Level Event Control

A dedicated **Layer Controller** orchestrates event flow across different layers of the object detection pipeline. It manages:
- Event synchronization between layers  
- Dynamic enabling and disabling of clusters  
- Sparse execution control based on event density  

This enables seamless execution of multi-layer detection networks without requiring global frame synchronization.

---

### Key Architectural Advantages

- Sparse connectivity reduces memory footprint and computation load  
- Event-triggered execution minimizes latency and power consumption  
- Modular and scalable cluster design supports diverse object detection models  
- FPGA-friendly architecture with clear ASIC migration path  

---

This event-driven and sparsely connected architecture enables **real-time object detection with significantly lower latency and energy consumption than conventional CPU-based or frame-driven accelerators**, making it highly suitable for edge intelligence applications.

##  Global Buffer (GLB) Architecture (Event-Driven & Sparse)

#### Global Buffer Architecture

The **Global Buffer (GLB) cluster** acts as the primary interface between the **event-driven accelerator core** and external memory (DRAM), enabling efficient storage and distribution of sparse, event-based data. Unlike conventional frame-driven buffers, the GLB in this architecture is optimized to handle **asynchronous event streams and sparse activations**, ensuring minimal memory access and low latency.

The GLB cluster consists of **event iact SRAMs and psum SRAMs**, carefully aligned with the distribution of the **Event-Driven PE array** to provide sufficient bandwidth under bursty event conditions. Each Event PE Cluster is serviced by corresponding GLB banks, allowing concurrent access and parallel event processing.

---

### Event-Based Data Storage

- **Event Iact SRAMs**  
  The iact SRAMs store **event-encoded sparse activations** rather than dense feature maps. Since events arrive asynchronously and in variable quantities, the iact SRAMs are designed to support irregular access patterns efficiently.

- **Psum SRAMs**  
  Partial sums (psums) generated by event-triggered computation are stored in dedicated psum SRAMs. Psums are written only when valid events are processed, avoiding unnecessary memory writes and reducing power consumption.

- **Weight Handling (Weight Stationary)**  
  Similar to a weight-stationary dataflow, **weights are stored locally within each Event PE’s internal weight SRAM**. The GLB does not allocate dedicated SRAM banks for weights; instead, it provides **dedicated weight ports** that connect directly to the event-aware weight routers. This minimizes global memory traffic and preserves locality.

---

### Sparse Event Metadata Management

Due to the **variable-length nature of event streams**, the size and boundaries of event data blocks cannot be determined using fixed counters. To address this, the GLB incorporates **Register Files (RFs)** alongside the iact SRAM banks. These RFs act as **lookup tables (LUTs)** that record:

- Start addresses of event groups  
- End addresses of event groups  
- Mapping between events and assigned Event PEs  

An internal **Event FSM Controller** manages these RFs by detecting **event delimiters** that indicate the end of an event group. This mechanism provides clear boundaries between event packets and ensures correct event retrieval and dispatch.

---

### Independent SRAM Operation

All SRAM banks within the GLB cluster are synthesized using **OpenRAM** and are designed to operate **independently**. This independence enables:
- Concurrent reads and writes across different event streams  
- Improved throughput under high event density  
- Reduced contention between iact and psum accesses  

Such parallelism is critical for sustaining real-time performance in event-driven object detection workloads.

---

### Event-Safe Data Communication

To guarantee data integrity and correct synchronization between the GLB and downstream modules, the GLB employs a **two-way handshake protocol** using `Valid` and `Ready` signals. This protocol ensures that:
- Events are transferred only when the receiving module is ready  
- No event data is lost or duplicated during asynchronous operation  
- The accelerator remains robust under variable event arrival rates  

---

### Key Advantages of Event-Driven GLB Design

- Efficient handling of sparse, asynchronous event data  
- Reduced SRAM access and power consumption  
- High concurrency through independently operating SRAM banks  
- Seamless integration with event routers and event-driven PEs  

---

This event-driven GLB architecture plays a critical role in enabling **low-latency, energy-efficient real-time object detection**, ensuring that memory access scales with event activity rather than input size.

##  Event-Based Router Architecture

The proposed **event-based router architecture** is inspired by the HM-NoC routing framework of **Eyeriss v2**, but is significantly redesigned to support **event-driven computation and sparse dataflow**. Unlike the original architecture, where routing decisions are made at the output endpoints using multiple multiplexers (MUXes), our design adopts an **early-decision routing strategy** tailored for asynchronous event streams.

In this architecture, as soon as an event arrives at the router, it is immediately processed by an **input-side MUX**, which operates in conjunction with the `in_sel` signal to determine the selected input data. The routing decision is completed early in the pipeline, while the `routing_mode` (`out_sel`) signal specifies the destination output port. By shifting routing intelligence closer to the input, the design reduces redundant selection logic, minimizes routing latency, and achieves a **75% reduction in MUX usage** compared to the original Eyeriss v2 router.

The router cluster is composed of **three event routers**, **three weight routers**, and **three psum routers**, enabling parallel and independent routing of sparse event data, weights, and partial sums. Each router is implemented using **circuit switching with MUX-based logic**, and **systolic registers** are inserted between router connections to ensure timing closure and stable data propagation across the cluster.

To support robust event-driven communication, the router employs a **three-way handshake protocol** using `Valid`, `Ready`, and the newly introduced `data_in_sel` control signal. While `Valid` and `Ready` ensure safe data transfer, `data_in_sel` explicitly selects the active input channel, enabling fine-grained control over sparse and asynchronous event traffic. The `routing_mode` (`out_sel`) signal further directs the event to the appropriate output port.

Compared to the original Eyeriss v2 router, this event-based router architecture provides enhanced flexibility, improved control over sparse data movement, and reduced hardware complexity. These design choices make the router highly suitable for **event-driven object detection accelerators**, where irregular data patterns and low-latency routing are critical for real-time performance.

# FPGA Verification

We implemented and verified the proposed **event-driven object detection accelerator** on an FPGA platform using a **2×2 event cluster configuration** deployed on the **Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA board**. The complete RTL design was synthesized using **Xilinx Vivado**, and the generated bitstream was programmed onto the ZCU102 to validate functional correctness, timing behavior, and real-time performance of the accelerator. This FPGA-based implementation enabled detailed evaluation of the event-driven control logic, sparse routing network, and event-aware processing elements under realistic hardware conditions.

For data transmission, the design leverages **PL-side high-speed interfaces** of the ZCU102 to receive event data directly from a host PC. A **custom UART-based communication protocol** was implemented to support asynchronous event streams, allowing sparse, event-driven data to be transferred efficiently to the programmable logic (PL). This setup ensures reliable communication while preserving the asynchronous nature of event-based processing.

The FPGA demonstration focuses on a **real-time object detection pipeline driven by event-based inputs**. On the host PC side, a **Python-based graphical user interface (GUI)** was developed to capture input data, generate sparse events based on motion or pixel-level changes, and transmit these events to the FPGA for inference. Once received, the event-driven accelerator processes the incoming event stream in real time and outputs detection results with low latency.

This verification framework closely mirrors practical deployment scenarios and highlights the advantages of the proposed event-driven architecture over traditional CPU-based approaches. The successful implementation on the ZCU102 FPGA validates the accelerator’s capability to efficiently handle sparse, asynchronous events, achieve real-time inference, and operate effectively in high-performance edge and embedded vision applications.

# Customized CNN Layer for Real-Time Object Detection (ZCU102 Demo)
To demonstrate real-time object detection on the **Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA**, we designed a **customized lightweight CNN layer** optimized specifically for **event-driven execution and low-latency inference**. Unlike conventional CNN layers that process dense feature maps, this customized layer operates on **sparse, event-based activations**, ensuring that computation is performed only when relevant events are present.

The CNN layer integrates **event-triggered convolution, simplified activation logic, and sparse partial-sum accumulation**, making it well-suited for FPGA deployment under strict timing and power constraints. The layer configuration is tailored to balance detection accuracy with hardware efficiency, enabling real-time processing on the ZCU102 without relying on CPU-based acceleration.

This customized CNN layer serves as the core inference block in the ZCU102 demonstration, validating the feasibility of **event-driven, hardware-accelerated object detection** for high-performance edge and embedded vision applications.
